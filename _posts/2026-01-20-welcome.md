If you are in Sri Lanka and enrolled your mobile number for various loyalty schemes offered by merchants, you'll be likely to recieve many SMS texts with merchant offers, notifications that fills up your sms inbox. Consider that you shop at Keells, Cargils, Laughs & Glomark supermarkets and have 
two bank accounts and Sampath Bank and Commercial bank having two credit cards with them. Then your SMS inbox will look like below. You're not alone ! This is how your inbox would look like. <br>
