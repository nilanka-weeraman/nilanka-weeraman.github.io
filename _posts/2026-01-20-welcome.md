If you are in Sri Lanka and enrolled your mobile number for various merchant loyalty schemes, you'll be likely to recieve many SMS texts with merchant offers, notifications that fills up your sms inbox. Consider that you shop at Keells, Cargils, Laughs & Glomark supermarkets and have 
two bank accounts and Sampath Bank and Commercial bank having two credit cards with them. Then your SMS inbox will look like below. <br> It is likely that you'd miss out an actually good offer notification. <br>

<img class="post-image" style="--post-image-width: 273px; --post-image-max: 320px;" src="{{ '/assets/images/inbox_nofilter.png' | relative_url }}" alt="SMS inbox example" width="90" height="260" />

What if there is a way to only see the active offers on a particular day, so that it saves time for you to read through the SMS , determine the merchant, offer active days, products applicable, offer details etc. <br>

<div class="post-image-row">
  <img class="post-image" style="--post-image-width: 273px; --post-image-max: 320px;" src="{{ '/assets/images/landing_page.jpeg' | relative_url }}" alt="Landing Page" width="90" height="260" />
  <img class="post-image" style="--post-image-width: 273px; --post-image-max: 320px;" src="{{ '/assets/images/merchant_summary.jpeg' | relative_url }}" alt="Glomark Offer Summary" width="90" height="260" />
</div>
So I vibe coded an Android app that does this. You can also code your own version. This is my way of learning the art of coding with AI by building something useful for me. This is infact the first time I built anything like this. So you can do better !<br>
I'll detail out how I did it. Along the way I had to learn new stuff and referenced somethings I've read. I'll try my best to give a full view without distracting you a lot. <br>
